## Binary - machine code

 - CPU is made to understand binary
 
 - Compilers - software that accepts our programs as input and output binary
 
## 4 steps of Compilation

 1. Preprocessing 
 
                 - certain predefined functions may be defined on hardware or in programs 
         
                 - need to be processed first
                 
 2. Compilation
 
                  - converts code to assembly instructions
                  
                  - the assembly instructions are lower level code that CPU understands
                  
                  - CPU doesn't understand C or Java
                  
 3. Assembly
 
                  - converts assembly code to binary
                  
 4. Linking
 
                  - links binary from seperate files
                  
                  

## 2 Types of Abstraction 

   1. Data Abstraction - hides details about data
   
   2. Control Abstraction - hides details about implementation
   
- In object oriented programming - can abstract both data and functions.
   
- Closures (Functional Programming)
   
   - Anonymous functions
   
- Lists

- Monads (Functional Programming)

- Triggers (RDBMS)
   

## RAM (Random Access Memory)

 - Used whenever you open or run a file
 
 - Only used when power of device is on
 
 - Much faster than Solid State
 
 - variables or characters/integers are actually physically stored in bits
 
 - Continuous memory (Lists and arrays) stored in bits back-to-back in RAM
 
 - 
 
## Solid State Drive

 - Much more space on hard drive than RAM
 
 


   
   
   
### Bytes - clusters of 8 bits

 - ASCII - uses only 8 bits - bits can only be permutated 256 ways - 256 different characters
  
 - Unicode - (UTF-8 - 8 bytes) - first 128 represent ASCII characters - over 95% of world's websites use UTF-8
  
 - 1 pixel in RGB (R = 1 byte, B = 1 byte, G = 1 byte)

### Parity 
 
   
### Gigahertz

### Integer Overflow and Underflow

### Variables - for storing data

### Threads - multiple scripts in one program that run at the same time

### Events -
